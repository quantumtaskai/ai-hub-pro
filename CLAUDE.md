# AI Hub Demo - Development Progress

## Project Overview
AI agent marketplace where users can use various AI agents by spending credits. Each agent redirects to its own page with custom functionality connected to n8n workflows.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. **Authentication & User Management**
- User registration/login with Supabase Auth
- Password reset functionality with email confirmation
- Profile management (name/email updates)
- Credit system with purchase options
- User state management with Zustand

#### 2. **Agent System Architecture**
- Agent slug mapping utility (`/lib/agentUtils.ts`)
- Main page redirects to individual agent pages instead of modals
- Shared components for all agent pages:
  - `AgentLayout` - Common layout with back button and credit display
  - `FileUpload` - Drag & drop file upload component
  - `ProcessingStatus` - Real-time status indicator
  - `ResultsDisplay` - Formatted results with copy/download
  - `CreditCounter` - Credit validation and deduction UI

#### 3. **Data Analyzer Agent (Template)**
- Complete agent page at `/agent/data-analyzer`
- File upload (PDF, CSV, Excel) up to 25MB
- Analysis type selection (Summary, Trends, Insights, Full)
- Direct n8n webhook integration
- Credit deduction on successful completion
- Error handling with specific messages
- Results display with copy/download options

#### 4. **N8N Integration**
- Direct webhook integration (simplified - no Google Sheets on frontend)
- FormData payload sent to n8n includes:
  ```
  file, analysisType, userId, agentId, fileName, fileSize
  ```
- Results returned directly from n8n webhook response

### 🔧 Configuration Setup

#### Environment Variables (`.env.local`)
```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# N8N Webhook (for Data Analyzer)
NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_DATA_ANALYZER=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/data-analyzer
```

#### Agent Slug Mapping
- Smart Customer Support Agent → `customer-support`
- Data Analysis Agent → `data-analyzer` ✅ (implemented)
- Content Writing Agent → `content-writer`
- Email Automation Agent → `email-automation`
- Sales Assistant Agent → `sales-assistant`
- Task Automation Agent → `task-automation`

### ✅ Current Status: Data Analyzer Complete & Working

#### What We Have:
1. **Working frontend** - Data analyzer page with file upload and processing UI ✅
2. **Webhook integration** - Sends FormData to n8n endpoint ✅
3. **Credit system** - Validates and deducts credits on success ✅
4. **Error handling** - Specific error messages for different failure types ✅
5. **N8N Workflow** - Complete workflow processing files and returning results ✅
6. **Formatted Results** - Beautiful display of analysis results ✅
7. **End-to-end Flow** - File upload → N8N processing → Results display → Credit deduction ✅

#### Response Format Working:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "analysis": "### Summary\n...\n### Key Points\n...",
  "processed_at": "2025-06-25T13:23:20.026Z"
}
```

### 📋 Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Complete Data Analyzer ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Frontend page with file upload
- ✅ N8N workflow setup and integration
- ✅ End-to-end testing successful
- ✅ Formatted results display
- ✅ Credit deduction working
- ✅ Google Sheets integration (N8N side)

#### Phase 2: Additional Agents (Future)
- Content Writer (`/agent/content-writer`)
- Customer Support (`/agent/customer-support`)
- Email Automation (`/agent/email-automation`)
- Sales Assistant (`/agent/sales-assistant`)
- Task Automation (`/agent/task-automation`)

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Setup N8N Webhook** for data analyzer
2. **Create N8N workflow** that:
   - Receives file upload and metadata
   - Processes/analyzes the data
   - Stores results in Google Sheets
   - Returns formatted JSON response
3. **Test complete flow** from frontend to n8n
4. **Iterate and refine** based on testing results
5. **Replicate pattern** for other agents

### 🔍 Key Files Modified

#### New Files Created:
- `/lib/agentUtils.ts` - Agent slug mapping
- `/lib/n8nService.ts` - N8N integration (advanced, not used yet)
- `/lib/googleSheetsService.ts` - Google Sheets API (not used yet)
- `/components/agent-shared/` - Shared agent components
- `/app/agent/data-analyzer/page.tsx` - Data analyzer agent page
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

#### Modified Files:
- `/app/page.tsx` - Updated useAgent to redirect to agent pages
- `/lib/supabase.ts` - Added slug field to Agent interface
- `/store/userStore.ts` - Added resetPassword function

### 💡 Design Decisions Made

1. **Simplified approach** - Direct n8n webhook responses instead of polling Google Sheets
2. **One agent at a time** - Complete data analyzer first before other agents
3. **Hardcoded agent pages** - No dynamic generation, each agent has custom page
4. **FormData approach** - For file uploads to n8n webhooks
5. **Credit deduction on success** - Only charge if workflow completes successfully

### 🎨 UI/UX Features

- Gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism design
- Real-time processing status with animations
- File drag & drop with preview
- Credit validation before processing
- Comprehensive error messages
- Copy/download results functionality
- Responsive layout with sidebar credit counter

## Current Focus
**Completing the Data Analyzer agent end-to-end flow** before expanding to other agents. The frontend is ready and waiting for the N8N webhook integration.
